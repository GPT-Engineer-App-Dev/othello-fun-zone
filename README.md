# othello-fun-zone

Implement an Othello (Reversi) game with the following:

- An 8x8 game board, using green and white circles for the pieces 
- Allow the user to click on an empty square to place their piece
- Enforce the rules for legal moves - pieces must be placed to capture opponent pieces
- Implement piece capturing by flipping the colors of captured pieces
- Use Chakra UI components for a polished look
- Make the UI responsive for different screen sizes

Don't implement game-ending logic or a computer player yet, I'll add those in a later step.
